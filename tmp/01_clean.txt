[Musk] Transferred down to the University of Pennsylvania and got a degree in physics, degree in business at Wharton. Came out to California with the intent of doing a PHD in the material science and physics [unintelligible] with an eye towards using that as an energy storage unit for electric vehicles.
[Musk] I ended up deferring that graduate work to start a couple to start a couple of area companies, one of which people have heard about, such as Pay Pal.
[Musk] So, what that allows you to do is to send money to a business or person just by entering an email address. And the money easily transfers from your Pay Pal account to their Pay Pal account.
[Musk] If you have money in Pay Pal account, it will do an internal transfer, almost like a bank transfer. If you don’t have money in your account, it’ll draw from your credit card or draw from your real world bank --
[Musk] And it’s -- you know, when you went to a web site -- a web site like a Knight Ridder newspaper web site or New York Times you wouldn’t know you would actually be using our software, but not know -- you wouldn’t that you were using our software, but you would be.
[Musk] So, any way, we sold that to Compaq for about 300 million dollars in cash in -- early in 99. And after I left the company and started what was originally called X.com which later became Pay Pal.
[Musk] And we have in development a big rocket which is the Falcon 9. And that’s intended to service the space station, as well as deliver very large satellites to orbit.
[Musk] But this is not in that category, this is really much thicker, deeper philosophical underpinings better financed to why I think it’s important to extend life beyond earth.
[Musk] It goes to the nature of importance. How do you decide that one thing is important versus another. And the layers of history -- I guess a good way to distinguish whether something is important or not.
[Musk] If you look at the history of the earth upon a geological grand scale -- what are the really important milestones in the history of life itself. Forget about the parochial concerns of humanity.
[Musk] Then you say, well, certainly there was the advent of single cell life, multi cellular life, plants versus animals --
[Musk] There’s the advent of mammals, the devopment of consciousness. These are -- there’s maybe ten or twelve things that fed on to that scale.
[Musk] And then within a subset of man’s achievements would be things like fire, wheel, the internet and that sort of thing.
[Musk] But then we also have McDonald Detweiler, a Canadian company, a customer we recently signed up for this commercial geo [unintelligible] satellite launch contract with Avanti which is a -- the UK commercial satellite operator.
[Musk] So -- you know we’ve been very successful in recruiting the top people out of those organizations. And they’re just really inefficient -- cost inefficient.
[Host] [speaking over each other]
[Musk] But once you reach a certain point where the communication inefficiency overwhelms the specialization of labor, then you actually get a declining – per employee
[Musk] Then we’ve got Model which will be after that and that’ll be hopefully in the 30 to 35 thousand dollar range and we’ve got 100 to 200 thousand [unintelligible] volume.
[Musk] So, we try to do higher and higher volume and they become more and more affordable over time. The Tesla Roadster, the sports car, is really the beachhead of the technology. It’s the introductory product, allows us to refine the technology and make more affordable over time.
[Musk] But in addition to the price of gas going up, the cost of electric transportation is going to go down, drive in part by companies like Tesla.
[Musk] So, that’s called the well to wheel efficiency. We do the fully [unintelligible] efficiency of a particular mode of transport. What it comes down to -- the reason -- the primary reason for that is that a gasoline engine is typically around 17 or 18 percent efficient.
[Musk] So, the energy in that gallon of gasoline -- the [unintelligible] [speaking over each other]
[Musk] But in comparison, the electric motor is a far more efficient device. The energy efficiency of electric motors is on the order of 90 percent. So that even after you take all those charging losses and all those other things into account, just have a fundamentally more efficient engine -- motor in the case of [unintelligible]
[Musk] But to answer your original question of what will charge -- we need the energy to charge the batteries for the cars and are we not simply extending the tail pipe to the power switch, so it’s a long tailpipe to the power station essentially.
[Musk] And the answer to that is -- well, first of all, electricity is the universal currency. You can generate electricity in many ways, including renewable ways such as solar power, wind, geothermal -- and in ways which are less damaging to the environment such as nuclear and -- and then even if you would generate energy with hydrocarbons such as coal or oil or natural gas, the energy efficiency of electric transportation is so much greater that you can still be twice as better off than you would otherwise be.
[Musk] So, our percentage of nuclear power has actually not declined as much -- [speaking over each other]
[Musk] Burning hydrocarbons -- I think people now recognize is a pretty bad thing. You know over time there’s a certain limit to the CO2 capacity of the atmosphere and the oceans.
[Musk] There would not be democracy in the world if not for the United States. We’re obviously falling in the recent few occasions -- maybe three separate occasions in the Twentieth Century -- democracy would have fallen with World War 1, World War 2 and the Cold War, but for the United States.
[Musk] But when historians look at these things on balance and measure the good with the bad -- and I think if you do that and -- on a rational basis and make a fair assessment -- I think it’s hard to [unintelligible] that the United States -- is there anything better [speaking over each other]
[Host] And that this provides us with such power and strength and influence -- as you said, unimaginable in human history.
[Musk] Because I think what actually happens is that the whole melting pot things with the cultures that people came from get added to the greater mix and actually enriches the diversity of the country more than if people simply retain their -- you know their original country’s culture unmodified, which seems like an odd thing to me.
[Musk] Because if you want the unmodified culture of your original country, then why would you move.
[Host] And the levels of -- I mean, America -- all the transnational polling shows that this is the most patriotic country in the world, but at the top of that high rating, its immigrants were saying this is a great place.
[Musk] And, so, there are actually many X Prizes. There’s the subliminal X Prize which was won by [unintelligible], sponsored by Paul Allen.
[Host] Revenues in your company have been going in what direction?
[Musk] So, part of it would [unintelligible] revenues percentage standpoint. But suffice it to say that next year Tesla will probably do 60 or 70 million dollars in revenue.
[Host] [Break In Interview] [CHANGING TAPES]
[Musk] I’m much more interested in the case of Tesla, Solar City, making impact on climate change and CO2 production and energy independence for those two companies and the case of SpaceX -- really primarily interested in making progress towards helping [unintelligible] become a space [unintelligible] civilization and ultimately extending life beyond earth.
[Musk] As a result, I expect that the companies will be valuable. Because it would be hard I think to accomplish those objectives and not be a valuable company.
[Host] And you know SDI -- Star Wars -- probably never would have worked [unintelligible] hitting a bullet with a bullet when they have 25 thousand MRVS. I mean, you can hit a few of them.
[Host] But it’s very interesting it may have been the most successful military program in history, put a few million bucks in it, give it to the Russians -- scare the hell out of the Russians.
[Host] Now, the question is why did it scare the Russians. It scared the Soviets because it was basically -- this industry was created by a bunch of guys in their backyards diddling around. They didn’t allow kids to diddle around in their backyards if it was against state policy.
[Host] So, they said, they can do it and we can’t do it. And, so, they started making deals which they would not have made if they weren’t afraid of SDI, which was nothing really to be afraid of.
[Host] But again I mean, [speaking over each other] my world view on this thing is the best thing we have going for it is [unintelligible]. It shows up in the market place, it shows up in health, it shows up in longevity, it shows up in technology, it shows up in politics and geo politics and -- you know, within certain limits.
[Host] If you allow free people to do things, they do great things.
[Host] [speaking over each other]
[Musk] [Laughter]
[Host] You don’t need knowledge to be a good President, you need that V thing, the vision thing and I think Reagan had it. I think Bush has it. People disagree. To say, you know, the analogy is you can’t turn your boat around -- the ship around -- you got to say -- it’s an ocean liner -- you move it -- and Reagan had the ability -- I sort of think Bush does -- but history will tell -- to say well take it over that way and don’t bother me with the details. You know what I want.
[Host] You know Kennedy and Reagan they brought something to the table that you can’t put a price on. They made Americans feel very good about themselves.
[Host] Now Kennedy didn’t do a whole lot, he died. He was killed too early. But for those years, people all around the world in America were saying that’s what America is like.
[Musk] And particularly prior to the stroke, his writings were actually quite smart. He was a smart guy--
